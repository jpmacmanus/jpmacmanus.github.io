# About me

I'm a second year student at the University of Bristol, studying *Mathematics and Computer Science*. I plan to graduate after 3 years and move straight into a Masters studying the Mathematical Sciences, before continuing on to hopefully complete a PhD in Mathematics and break into academia.

My key academic interests are *algebra*, *combinatorics*, as well as *algorithm theory*. I am also a keen programmer in *Haskell*, *Java* and occasionally also *C*.

# Current Projects

Alongside curricular studies, I am currently working on a small number of projects, both theoretical and practical in nature.

- **Munny** - A small budgetting program built from the ground up in Java, for my own personal use.

- **Smith** - A small Haskell module for calculating the Smith normal-form of an integer matrix.

- **Project Euler** - In my free time I've managed to solve around 30 problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, a collection of problems both mathematical and computational in nature.

- **This website** - This site has been built from the ground up by hand, using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator, and is constantly evolving as my tastes change.

In the coming Summer (2019), I will be working with a small number of other students on a research project concerning *quantum speed-ups of classical algorithms*.
