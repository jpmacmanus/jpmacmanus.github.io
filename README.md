# All the code for my personal website

Find here the code to my personal website, hosted by GitHub Pages [here](https://jpmacmanus.github.io/).

## TODO

- Work on mobile friendliness a little bit

- Choose an accent colour

- Add links to sidebar (insta, twitter, linkedin etc)

- Grab a custom domain from somewhere

- High-res banner images now seem like a silly idea - rework that
