# All the code for my personal website

Find here the code to my personal website, hosted by GitHub Pages [here](https://jpmacmanus.github.io/).

#### TODO

- Currently up to 10 posts display on the front page, there needs to be of notification at the bottom that "more posts are available in the archive", or ideally some pagination. 

- perhaps let the little profile window exist on mobile devices, above the post feed. (but this isn't important). 

## Credits

Big thanks to Long Qian whose plugin-free tag system I shamelessly stole from [here](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).
