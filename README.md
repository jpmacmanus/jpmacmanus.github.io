# All the code for my personal website

Find here the code to my personal website, hosted by GitHub Pages [here](https://jpmacmanus.github.io/).

#### TODO

- Redo contact page

- Grab a custom domain from somewhere

- Add a markdown cv

- Use jekyll-tags plugin?

- Use pagination plugin?

- Overhaul to a more minimal design

- scale down images used in blog post 1 to a reasonable size

## Credits

Big thanks to Long Qian whose plugin-free tag system I shamelessly stole from [here](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).
