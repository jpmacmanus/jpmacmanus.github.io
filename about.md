# About Me

I am a recent graduate from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), and an incoming graduate student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). My key academic interests lie within abstract algebra (particularly group theory), combinatorics, and theoretical computer science.

I plan to begin a PhD in 2021, and I am currently searching for a supervisor.  

# Pre-Prints

**Quantum speedups of some general-purpose numerical optimisation algorithms**  
*Submitted to Quantum Science and Technology (under revision)*, [arXiv:2004.06521](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06521)   
Alexandru, Cezar-Mihail; Bridgett-Tomkinson, Ella; Linden, Noah; MacManus, Joseph; Montanaro, Ashley; Morris, Hannah.


# Education

*MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science (MFoCS) - 2020 to 2021*  
\- An emphasis on group theory, and theory of computation.

**University of Bristol**  
*BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science, first class honours - 2017 to 2020*  
\- Bachelor's thesis: *Decision problems within combinatorial group theory*, supervised by Dr Philipp Schlicht.

**Ysgol Aberconwy 6th Form**

# Experience

**Maths Caf√© Leader (Combinatorics)**  
*University of Bristol - October 2019 to Present*  
\- Running a weekly drop-in session, which functions as a more informal problems class.

**Teaching Assistant (Algorithms I-II)**  
*University of Bristol - October 2019 to Present*  
\- Duties including running office hours and helping in problems classes.

**Research Intern**  
*University of Bristol - Summer 2019*  
\- Working on a research project concerning quantum speed-ups of classical algorithms.

**GCSE and A-Level Mathematics Tutor**  
*Metatutor - 2018 to Present*  
\- Tutored a good number of students through various levels of maths alongside my own studies.

*. . . also several years of customer service experience which I shan't list here.*

<!-- # Current Projects

I sometimes do things, like the following:

- **Munny** - A small budgeting program built from the ground up in Java, for my own personal use. View the source code, follow progress and more importantly find a better description [here](https://github.com/jpmacmanus/munny).

- **Smith** - A small Haskell module for calculating the Smith normal-form of an integer matrix.

- **Project Euler** - In my free time I've managed to solve around 30 problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, a collection of problems both mathematical and computational in nature.

- **This website** - This site has been built from the ground up by hand, using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator, and is constantly evolving as my tastes change.

In the coming Summer (2019), I will be working with a small number of other students on a research project concerning quantum speed-ups of classical algorithms. -->
