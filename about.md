# About Me

I'm a third year student at the University of Bristol, studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I plan to graduate after 3 years and move straight into a Masters studying the Mathematical Sciences, before continuing on to hopefully complete a PhD in Mathematics and break into academia.

My key academic interests are algebra, combinatorics, as well as algorithm theory. I am also a keen programmer in Haskell, Java and occasionally also C.

# Education

**University of Oxford** *(incoming)*  
*Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science (MSc) - 2020 to 2021*  
\- An emphasis on group theory, and theory of computation. 

**University of Bristol**  
*Mathematics and Computer Science (BSc) - 2017 to 2020 (Ongoing)*  
\- Topics studied include various programming paradigms, commutative and linear algebra, and combinatorics. This year I am working on a project concerning decidability within combinatorial group theory.

**Ysgol Aberconwy 6th Form**  
*3 A-Levels, at A\*A\*A\* - 2015 to 2017*  
\- Above results achieved in Maths, Further Maths, and Physics.

**Coleg Llandrillo (Via Conwy LiNC)**  
*Level 3 BTEC in Programming, at Dist\* - 2015 to 2017*  
\- Languages studied include C#, Visual Basic, as well as web development in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# Experience

**Maths Caf√© Leader (Combinatorics)**  
*University of Bristol - October 2019 to Present*  
\- Running a weekly drop-in session, which functions as a more informal problems class.

**Teaching Assistant (Algorithms I-II)**  
*University of Bristol - October 2019 to Present*  
\- Duties including running office hours and helping in problems classes.

**Research Intern**  
*University of Bristol - Summer 2019*  
\- Working on a research project concerning quantum speed-ups of classical algorithms, within the School of Maths. My project report can be found in its current form [here](assets\files\quantum.pdf).

**GCSE and A-Level Mathematics Tutor**  
*Metatutor - 2018 to Present*  
\- Tutored a good number of students through various levels of maths alongside my own studies.

*. . . also several years of customer service experience which I shan't list here.*

<!-- # Current Projects

I sometimes do things, like the following:

- **Munny** - A small budgeting program built from the ground up in Java, for my own personal use. View the source code, follow progress and more importantly find a better description [here](https://github.com/jpmacmanus/munny).

- **Smith** - A small Haskell module for calculating the Smith normal-form of an integer matrix.

- **Project Euler** - In my free time I've managed to solve around 30 problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, a collection of problems both mathematical and computational in nature.

- **This website** - This site has been built from the ground up by hand, using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator, and is constantly evolving as my tastes change.

In the coming Summer (2019), I will be working with a small number of other students on a research project concerning quantum speed-ups of classical algorithms. -->
