# About Me

I am a postgraduate student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), and a recent graduate from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). I'm am mainly interested in combinatorial and geometric group theory, as well as complexity and combinatorics.

Later this year I will begin study of a DPhil here in Oxford, funded by the [Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research](https://heilbronn.ac.uk/).

<!-- # Current Projects

I sometimes do things, like the following:

- **Munny** - A small budgeting program built from the ground up in Java, for my own personal use. View the source code, follow progress and more importantly find a better description [here](https://github.com/jpmacmanus/munny).

- **Smith** - A small Haskell module for calculating the Smith normal-form of an integer matrix.

- **Project Euler** - In my free time I've managed to solve around 30 problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, a collection of problems both mathematical and computational in nature.

- **This website** - This site has been built from the ground up by hand, using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator, and is constantly evolving as my tastes change.

In the coming Summer (2019), I will be working with a small number of other students on a research project concerning quantum speed-ups of classical algorithms. -->
